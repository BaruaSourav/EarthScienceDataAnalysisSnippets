# Earth Science Data Analysis Snippets

### 1. DateTimeFormatInDepth.ipynb

Imported the data of flood occurances of at Boulder, Colorado, USA from earthpy dataset. The data represents the precipitation and weather data of that area from 2003-2013. Later this notebook explores options like `parse_csv()`, `na_values()`, `index_col()` and later it presents some functions from matplotlib to display scatter plot. Then resampled the data on their `datetime` indices and plotted them.
